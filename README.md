# DESCRIPTION OF TASKS
Geometric Mark â€“ "NEXUS"
A minimalist design featuring a clean, scalable geometric symbol with a bold sans-serif typeface. The triangle icon offers visual balance and clarity, effective with or without the brand name.

Icon Mark â€“ "VERTEX" (Selected)
The selected design uses a tech-inspired network node symbol, representing connectivity and digital systems. The icon has a strong standalone presence and aligns well with SaaS or AI-based product identities.

Wordmark â€“ "STRIDE"
A typography-focused logo that conveys professionalism and elegance. The type is paired with a fine tagline and features customized letter spacing and subtle detailing to enhance brand sophistication.

ðŸŽ¯ Design Highlights:
All logos are scalable, responsive, and optimized for light and dark backgrounds.

Typography choices emphasize clarity and modern appeal.

Each concept is presented with its mockup applications (app splash screen, website header, and card preview).

ðŸ”— Tools Used:
Figma â€“ Vector design, typography handling, layout, and mockups

Google Fonts â€“ Clean sans-serif pairings

Color Palette â€“ Soft tech-blue tones for digital trust and presence

This task strengthened my ability to think through brand identity systems and how to align design aesthetics with functional versatility.
